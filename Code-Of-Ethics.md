**COMMUNITY STATEMENT** </br>
The idea for Diasporadical Radio was inspired by ongoing converstaions about growing pains of a music industry landscape built off of immaterial labor, distribution networks and MP3 files. 
We first and foremost acknowledge the cultural labor done by people across the globe which is not acknowledged an unpaid, and recognize that these people are usually Black / Indigenous from the Global South and from Occupied places.   
We are in solidarity with people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, age and accessibility level. 
We would like to receive technical input and music input from people from across the globe. 

**RESOLVING CONFLICT** </br>
We are all human and conflict is inevitable. In a time of conflict we encourage the following behavior:
- Listen.
- Speak from the first-person perspective. 
- Clearly communicate while acknowledging other's feelings.
- Apologize by admitting the error, accepting responsibility and verbalizing how you will change for future scenariors. 
- Recognize this community is respectful and open and we are all mindful of our actions
