## MUSIC
To add music, go to the landing site and drag the purple dot to the location from where the artist is from. Diasporadical radio is in constant engagement with diaspora as a theory and a direct manifestation of both forced and chosen immigration due to things like colonialism, war, famine as well as love and hope. When we say where is an artist "from" we mean this can mean a lot of things. Choose a location where the artist is based, where the artist's sound is incubated or where the artist claims roots. 

Once the dot is over a specific location (can be specific as a neighborhood or as general as a country), double click. 

Fill out the form with a Youtube Video. 

Go back to the main page. You should see your music added :)
