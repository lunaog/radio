# DIASPORADICAL RADIO

Diasporadical Radio is an open-source and user-generated geographic map of independent global artists (artists not backed by Sony, Universal or Colombia), which focuses on people of the global south, indigenous and Black people. The map is open-source and works from user-generated data in order to present artists that slip through algorithms and do not show up on our corporate-curated playlists. By allowing users to contribute, the map creates a community of people with hopefully different tastes, but similar creative and political values. Diasporadical Radio is based off the idea that sound is incubated collectively, so community is a vital aspect of the process of music distribution. In a world where we rely on machines to tell us what to listen to (and more increasingly, what to make), it is important that us subjects take control of our listening process.
